            <h3>Now an excerpt from the Magna Carta</h3>
            <p class="magna">Edward by the grace of God King of England, lord of Ireland and duke of Aquitaine sends greetings
                to all to whom the present letters come. We have inspected the great charter of the lord Henry, late
                King of England, our father, concerning the liberties of England in these words:
                Henry by the grace of God King of England, lord of Ireland, duke of Normandy and Aquitaine and
                count of Anjou sends greetings to his archbishops, bishops, abbots, priors, earls, barons, sheriffs,
                reeves, ministers and all his bailiffs and faithful men inspecting the present charter. Know that we, at
                the prompting of God and for the health of our soul and the souls of our ancestors and successors, for
                the glory of holy Church and the improvement of our realm, freely and out of our good will have
                given and granted to the archbishops, bishops, abbots, priors, earls, barons and all of our realm these
                liberties written below to hold in our realm of England in perpetuity.</p>
